            <p>How do I know I'll get a nice tree?</p>
          </div>
          <div class='faq-padding'>
            <p>Good question! Christmas trees are purchased from tree farmer's based on three grades. They are premium grade, #1 grade and #2 grade. Premium grade trees are the "cream of the crop". They are guaranteed to be the best tree's the farmer has grown for that given year. We ONLY purchase and deliver premium grade tree's.</p>

            <p>What is the difference between Frasier fir and Balsam fir?</p>
          </div>
          <div class='faq-padding'>
            <p>The Balsam fir is a beautiful pyramidal tree with short, flat, long-lasting, aromatic needles. It is characterized by a nice, dark green color and is very fragrant.

            The Fraser fir is quickly becoming the most premium species of the cut Christmas tree market. Its mild fragrance, shape, strong limbs, and ability to retain its soft needles for a long time when cut make it one of the best trees for this purpose. It is characterized by a heavy density and is known for its deep hues of blueish green.</p>

            <p>Will the tree shed?</p>
          </div>
          <div class='faq-padding'>
            <p>It's only natural that most trees will shed some needles in the weeks leading up to Christmas Day. Since all of our trees are premium grade and cut very close to Thanksgiving, If they're given proper water and kept at a reasonable distance from heat sources, there should be minimal shedding.</p>

            <p>How should I best care for my tree?</p>
          </div>
          <div class='faq-padding'>
            <p>Add water to your stand immediately when you bring your tree into the house. Keep as far away as possible from heat sources. Check daily to make sure the water does not go below the base of the tree.</p>
